      <h2 class="section-title">What is Açaí?</h2>
      <div class="acai-info">

        <p class="acai-description">
          The açaí (pronounced ah-sigh-EE) palm tree, native to Central and South America, grows up to 25 meters tall with ribbon-like leaves and clusters of berries. Each tree yields about 20 kg of fruit annually, making it a key Brazilian crop. Traditionally pulped for wine, only the berry is used, usually seedless. Highly perishable, açaí must be processed within 24 hours into juice, wine, frozen puree, or powder. Also known as the Amazonian palm berry, it has long been valued for its healing, immune-boosting, and energizing properties.

          <h3>Why Açaí is Called a Superfood</h3>
          <p>
            Açaí berries earn their superfood status through their exceptional nutritional profile. They contain more antioxidants than blueberries, more calcium than milk, and healthy omega fatty acids similar to those found in olive oil. Their deep purple color comes from anthocyanins, powerful plant compounds known for their anti-inflammatory and heart-healthy properties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beyond just being delicious, each açaí bowl you enjoy at Acai of Alaska delivers a concentrated dose of nutrients that support overall wellness, energy levels, and immune function—perfect for the Alaskan lifestyle.
